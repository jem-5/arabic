Numbers are an essential part of any language, and Arabic is no different. Whether you're shopping at the market, checking the time, or discussing prices, knowing how to count and use numbers in Arabic is key to navigating everyday conversations. While learning the Arabic number system might seem a bit intimidating at first, it’s a manageable and useful part of your Arabic learning journey.

In this blog post, we’ll break down Arabic numbers, how to count, and practical tips for using them in daily conversations.

**1. The Basics: Arabic Numerals vs. Western Numerals**

Interestingly, the numerals we use in English (1, 2, 3, etc.) actually originated from the Arabic numeral system. However, the digits used in many Arabic-speaking countries are different from what’s used in the West. Here are the numerals in both forms:

- **Western Arabic numerals**: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
- **Arabic numerals**: ٠ ١ ٢ ٣ ٤ ٥ ٦ ٧ ٨ ٩

These numerals are used in written Arabic, especially in more formal or traditional contexts. That being said, in many places, especially in the Levant and Egypt, Western Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, etc.) are widely used alongside traditional Arabic numerals. It’s helpful to be familiar with both.

**2. Counting from 1 to 10 in Arabic**

Let’s start by learning how to count from 1 to 10, as this forms the foundation for higher numbers:

- 1 – واحد (waahid)
- 2 – اثنان (ithnayn)
- 3 – ثلاثة (thalaatha)
- 4 – أربعة (arba’a)
- 5 – خمسة (khamsa)
- 6 – ستة (sitta)
- 7 – سبعة (sab’a)
- 8 – ثمانية (thamaaniya)
- 9 – تسعة (tis’a)
- 10 – عشرة (’ashara)

These numbers are commonly used in daily conversations, and mastering them is crucial. Notice that some numbers, like "1" (waahid) and "2" (ithnayn), have gender variations, which we’ll explain later in the context of using numbers with nouns.

**3. Counting from 11 to 20**

Next, we’ll cover numbers from 11 to 20:

- 11 – أحد عشر (ahada ‘ashar)
- 12 – اثنا عشر (ithna ‘ashar)
- 13 – ثلاثة عشر (thalaatha ‘ashar)
- 14 – أربعة عشر (arba’a ‘ashar)
- 15 – خمسة عشر (khamsa ‘ashar)
- 16 – ستة عشر (sitta ‘ashar)
- 17 – سبعة عشر (sab’a ‘ashar)
- 18 – ثمانية عشر (thamaaniya ‘ashar)
- 19 – تسعة عشر (tis’a ‘ashar)
- 20 – عشرون (’ishroon)

From 11 to 19, you’ll notice the pattern of combining the root number (like waahid, ithnayn, etc.) with "’ashar," meaning ten. After 20, numbers follow a regular structure.

**4. Counting by Tens: 30, 40, 50…**

Counting by tens follows a straightforward pattern. Here are the multiples of ten:

- 20 – عشرون (’ishroon)
- 30 – ثلاثون (thalaathoon)
- 40 – أربعون (arba’oon)
- 50 – خمسون (khamsoon)
- 60 – ستون (sittoon)
- 70 – سبعون (sab’oon)
- 80 – ثمانون (thamaanoon)
- 90 – تسعون (tis’oon)
- 100 – مئة (mi’a)

These numbers are used often in larger conversations, especially when discussing prices, ages, and measurements.

**5. Cardinal vs. Ordinal Numbers**

Like in English, Arabic distinguishes between **cardinal numbers** (used for counting) and **ordinal numbers** (used for ranking or ordering).

For example, cardinal numbers are used in everyday situations like:

- "I have five books" – لدي خمسة كتب (Ladaya khamsa kutub).

Ordinal numbers are used when referring to a position or rank:

- "First" – الأول (al-awwal) for masculine, الأولى (al-oola) for feminine.
- "Second" – الثاني (al-thaani) for masculine, الثانية (al-thaaniya) for feminine.
- "Third" – الثالث (al-thaalith) for masculine, الثالثة (al-thaalitha) for feminine.

Ordinal numbers are particularly useful when giving directions, discussing dates, or ranking items.

**6. Gender and Numbers**

Arabic numbers, like many elements of the language, change based on the gender of the noun they are referring to. Arabic nouns are either masculine or feminine, and the number used with the noun must match its gender.

For numbers 3 to 10, the numbers actually take on the **opposite** gender of the noun:

- ثلاثة كتب (thalaatha kutub) – "three books" (where "books" is masculine, but the number is feminine).
- ثلاث سيارات (thalaath sayaaraat) – "three cars" (where "cars" is feminine, but the number is masculine).

This rule doesn’t apply to the numbers 1 and 2, where the number will agree in gender with the noun:

- كتاب واحد (kitaab waahid) – "one book" (masculine).
- سيارة واحدة (sayaara waahida) – "one car" (feminine).

This gender-number agreement may seem tricky at first, but with practice, it becomes second nature.

**7. Using Numbers in Everyday Conversations**

Now that you know how to count in Arabic, let’s look at some common scenarios where you’ll use numbers in everyday conversations:

- **Talking about age**:

  - "I am 25 years old" – عمري خمسة وعشرون سنة (‘umri khamsa wa ‘ishroon sana).

- **Buying or selling**:

  - "How much does this cost?" – كم سعر هذا؟ (Kam si’r hadha?).
  - "It costs 30 dirhams" – ثمنه ثلاثون درهما (Thamanuhu thalaathoon dirhaman).

- **Telling time**:

  - "It’s 3 o’clock" – الساعة الثالثة (As-saa’a ath-thaalitha).
  - "I’ll meet you at 5" – سأراك الساعة الخامسة (Sa’araaka as-saa’a al-khaamisa).

- **Discussing dates**:

  - "Today is the 12th of June" – اليوم هو الثاني عشر من يونيو (Al-yawm huwa ath-thani ‘ashar min Yooniyoo).

  **8. Tips for Learning Arabic Numbers**

Mastering Arabic numbers takes practice, but here are some tips to help you along the way:

- **Practice daily**: Incorporate numbers into your daily Arabic practice. Count objects around you, practice reading prices, or try telling the time in Arabic.
- **Use flashcards**: Create flashcards with both Arabic numerals and written forms to reinforce your memory.
- **Watch Arabic media**: Listen to Arabic speakers use numbers in context by watching Arabic news, TV shows, or YouTube channels.
- **Engage in real-life situations**: When shopping or traveling, try to use Arabic numbers in real-world conversations to build confidence.

Arabic numbers are not only practical for daily conversations but are also a fascinating part of the language to learn. By understanding how to count, use cardinal and ordinal numbers, and navigate gender agreement, you’ll gain valuable skills to communicate more effectively in Arabic. Remember, practice makes perfect, so try to incorporate numbers into your Arabic learning routine every day. With time, you’ll be confidently counting and using numbers like a native speaker!
